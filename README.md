# FRCC

FRCC is a congestion control algorithm designed to *provably* guarantee bounds
on fairness on networks with jitter.

This repository accompanies the paper: "Towards Fair and Robust Congestion
Control (to appear in NSDI 26)", and includes FRCC's kernel implementation,
benchmarking, and proofs.
